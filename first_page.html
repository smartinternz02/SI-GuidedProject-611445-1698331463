    <h1>Predicting the occurrence of Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD)</h1>

    <p>Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) is a highly contagious viral disease that affects cattle and poses a significant threat to livestock industries worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of LSD outbreaks are crucial for effective disease control and prevention.</p>

    <p>Predicting the occurrence of Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) based on meteorological and geospatial features is an active area of research and surveillance efforts. Several studies have explored the relationship between environmental factors and the spread of LSD. However, it is important to note that predicting disease outbreaks is a complex task influenced by numerous variables, and no single factor can accurately predict disease occurrence.</p>

    <p>By integrating meteorological and geospatial data with historical disease information, machine learning algorithms can be applied to develop predictive models for disease outbreaks. These models can help identify areas at higher risk of LSD occurrence based on the environmental factors that facilitate disease transmission. In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model to predict the occurrence of Lumpy Skin Disease using a dataset containing various geographical and environmental factors.</p>
